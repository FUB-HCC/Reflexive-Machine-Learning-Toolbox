# What
The reflexive machine learning (ML) toolbox provides a pipeline and task-oriented tools for the analysis of text data by means of machine learning techniques.
The tools are taylored to use cases in interpretivist social research and the humantities (e.g. digital media studies, sociology, historical research, anthropology, political science, science and technology studies). We not propose a 'mixed methods approach' combining qualitative and statistical methods. Rather, our tools aim at making a variety of text corpora 'ready-at-hand' for qualitative analysis. Considering this rooting  'reflexive' approach to digital data analysis 

# Who
The reflexive ML toolbox is the outcome of an interdisciplinary collaboration at the [Human-Centered Computing](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/inf/groups/hcc/index.html) research group of Freie Universität Berlin.
