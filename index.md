# What
The reflexive machine learning (ML) toolbox provides a pipeline and task-oriented tools for the analysis of text data by means of machine learning techniques.
The tools are taylored to use cases in interpretivist social research and the humantities (e.g. digital media studies, sociology, historical research, anthropology, political science, science and technology studies). Rather than providing statistical methods for text analysis, our tools aim at supporting qualitative analysis processes such as data exploration, labeling, coding and analysis. We thrive for a 'reflexive' approach to digital data analysis, which enables a critical reflection of the ways our techniques co-construct our research objects and phenomena.

# Who
The reflexive ML toolbox is the outcome of an interdisciplinary collaboration at the [Human-Centered Computing](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/inf/groups/hcc/index.html) research group of Freie Universität Berlin. 
Main contributors are [Michael Tebbe](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/inf/groups/hcc/members/researchers/tebbe.html), [Simon David Hirsbrunner](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/inf/groups/hcc/members/researchers/hirsbrunner.html) and [Claudia Müller-Birn](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/inf/groups/hcc/members/professor/mueller-birn.html).
